Here's the improved Python code for a fully functioning chat app using FastAPI and OpenAI's GPT-4 that allows users to upload a PDF file and responds with a summary of its contents. The code includes several enhancements:

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes `async` functions for better performance.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved exception handling and logging.
- **User Authentication**: Implements basic user authentication using OAuth2.
- **Rate Limiting**: Adds rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Support for Multiple File Types**: Allows uploading of PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
- **Session Management**: Maintains user sessions with secure cookies.
- **Responsive Frontend**: Improved HTML templates for better user experience.
- **Internationalization**: Supports text extraction and summarization in multiple languages.
- **Background Tasks**: Processes large files without blocking the main thread.
- **Database Integration**: Stores summaries for quick retrieval.



**Note**: This script assumes you have the necessary templates (`upload_form.html`, `processing.html`, `summary.html`, `error.html`) and static files in place. You'll need to create these templates according to your application's design.

**Additional Instructions**:

- Ensure that you have a `.env` file or environment variables set for `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL`.
- Adjust `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the environment variables to specify which hosts are allowed to access the API.
- Install all the required packages in your virtual environment.
- Make sure your database is properly set up and accessible.

**Security Considerations**:

- Use HTTPS in production to secure communications.
- Implement more robust authentication and authorization for user management.
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

**Error Handling**:

- The code includes comprehensive error handling to capture and log exceptions.
- Users are presented with user-friendly error messages via templates.

**Scalability**:

- Asynchronous processing and background tasks are used to handle large files without blocking.
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

**Extensibility**:

- The app is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to add new features like support for more file types or advanced summarization options.

**Internationalization**:

- The code allows for specifying the language, enabling summarization in different languages if supported by the OpenAI API.

Please customize and test the code thoroughly to suit your specific requirements and environment.
