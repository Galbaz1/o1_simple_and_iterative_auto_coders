**Explanation of Fixes:**

1. **Automatic Installation of Missing Modules:**
   - Added a block at the beginning of the code to check for missing required packages (`fastapi`, `PyPDF2`, `openai`, `tiktoken`, `uvicorn`) and install them if they're not already installed.
   - This ensures that all necessary dependencies are available when the script is run, preventing `ModuleNotFoundError`.

2. **Set OpenAI API Key Fallback:**
   - Modified the line where the OpenAI API key is set to include a fallback option. If the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, it will use a placeholder `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`. Replace this with your actual API key if not using environment variables.

   

3. **Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:**
   - Included a conditional block to run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn when the script is executed directly.
   - This allows the script to be run from the command line and starts the server, making the API accessible.

   

4. **Included `uvicorn` in Required Packages:**
   - Added `uvicorn` to the set of required packages since it's used to run the FastAPI app.

**Note:** Ensure that you have network access for the script to install packages and communicate with the OpenAI API. Also, remember to replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key or set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
