Here's the full fixed code:



**Explanation of the fix:**

The error occurred because the `python-multipart` package, which is required for handling file uploads with FastAPI, was not installed. The error message suggested installing it:

```
Form data requires "python-multipart" to be installed. 
You can install "python-multipart" with: 

pip install python-multipart
```

To fix this, I added `'python-multipart'` to the set of required packages in your code:



This ensures that if `python-multipart` is missing, the code will automatically install it before running the FastAPI application.

**Note on Deprecation Warning:**

You might have noticed a deprecation warning for `pkg_resources`:

```
DeprecationWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html
  import pkg_resources
```

While this is just a warning and doesn't stop your code from running, you can suppress it or update the package checking mechanism to use `importlib.metadata` (for Python 3.8 and above) as follows:



If you decide to use this updated method, replace the `pkg_resources` import and related code with the snippet above.

**Remember:**

- Ensure your OpenAI API key is set correctly either as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` or replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.
- The OpenAI model `"gpt-4"` is used in this code. If you don't have access to this model, you can replace it with `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` or any other available model.
- If you encounter any other missing package errors, consider adding them to the `required` set.
